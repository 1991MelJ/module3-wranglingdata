module3-wranglingdata
=====================

In the previous module, we successfully grabbed *lots* of data from various online repositories. Some of it was already in well-structured tables; much of it was not. All of it was text though. Initially, it (or most of it) was just scanned images of documents. At some point, _object character recognition_ was used to identify the black dots from the white dots in those images, to recognize the patterns that make up letters, numbers, and punctuation. There are commercial products that can do this (and we have some installed in the Underhill Research Room that you can use), and there are [free products that you can install](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2014/07/15/doing-ocr-within-r/) on your computer to do it yourself.

It all looks so neat and tidy. Ian Milligan discusses this ['illusionary order'](http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/k002j61230g4556w/?p=8d64dca8cfec44e8b4858483ebf23daf&pi=2) and its implications for historians:
>In this article, I make two arguments. Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely – if ever – made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databases. Secondly, historians need to understand how OCR works, in order to bring a level of methodological rigor to their work that use these sources.

Just as we saw with Ted Underwood's article on [theorizing search](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/rep.2014.127.1.64), these 'simple' steps in the research process are anything but. They are also profoundly theoretical in how they change what it is we can know. In archaeology, every step of the method, every stage in the process, has a profound impact on the stories we eventually tell about the past. Decisions we make destroy data, and create new data. Historians aren't used to thinking about these kinds of issues!

There are also _manual_ ways of doing the same thing as OCR does - we call these things 'humans', and we organize their work through 'crowdsourcing'. We break the process up into wee manageable steps, and make these available over the net. Sometimes we gamify these steps, to make them more 'fun'. If several people all work on the same piece of text, the thinking is that errors will cancel each other out: a proper transcription will emerge from the work of the crowd. Take a look at these two pieces concerning the _Transcribe Bentham_ project:
