#Twitter Archiving, or TWARC

Ed Summers is a software developer with feet firmly planted in the digital humanities world. He's currently at the Univeristy of Maryland, in the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/). Recently, he has built a [python tool](http://mith.umd.edu/) for searching and grabbing tweets (and all their associated metadata, which is extremely rich), called '[Twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc)'.

In this optional exercise, you will install Twarc on your machine and use it to download all of the tweets hashtagged with '#hist3907b'. Once you've seen that it's working, you will then consider Twitter as a place for performing history. Perhaps you'll search for tweets related to a current event (the first draft of history, as the journalists used to call their work), perhaps you'll see what people are saying about a historic event, person, or place. Perhaps you'll try to map out how effective/affective those 'historical' twitter accounts are (like the ones that tweet WWII in 'real-time', or that purport to be the Emperor Hadrian).

## Getting set up.

The first thing you'll need for this exercise is Python. Python is a programming language heavily used by historians and humanists. You will have noticed that many of the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/) tutorials are written in Python. We won't be writing any code; we just need Python on your machine so that your computer understands how to interpret Twarc commands.
